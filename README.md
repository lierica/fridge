# Fridgey README
Fridgey helps you keep better track of what's in your fridge in order to prevent food waste. Fridgey recommends items to eat before expiration and shows which meals are expiring most often.

## Description
After a user creates a Fridgey account, they can add frozen meals to their freezer and fresh ingredients to their fridge.  If a frozen meal or ingredient doesn't exist yet in the Fridgey system, the user can add it and add information about its expiration date.

### Dashboard
The dashboard shows users the frozen meals and fresh ingredients in their fridge that are still good, and the number of days left until expiration.  The dashboard also shows the expired items that are currently in the fridge.  From the dashboard, the user can throw out expired items and eat frozen meals and fresh ingredients.  

### Analytics
This page provides the user statistics regarding which items are expiring most often, and which are most frequently eaten.  By utilizing this feedback, a user can cut down on food waste and save money.

#### Bonus "easter egg"
The co-creators of Fridgey were getting a bit loopy as the deadline approached, and decided to slip an "audio greeting" into the homepage at top right.  Fun times.   

### Technical Features
+ Used Rails to create a web application with RESTful routing and full CRUD capabilities.
